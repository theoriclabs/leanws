# Releasing LeanWs

Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` for every user-visible change. Collect changes under
`Unreleased` while developing, then move them into a dated version section when
releasing. Describe observable behavior and any migration steps.

## Prepare

1. Choose the version. Use a patch release for compatible fixes and a minor
   release for new capabilities. Before 1.0, document any breaking changes
   explicitly in the minor release notes.
2. Update `lakefile.lean`, `LeanWs/Version.lean`, and the installation tag in
   `README.md` together.
3. Add the dated changelog section, leave an `Unreleased` section at the top,
   and update the release and comparison links.
4. Run `lake test`. It builds and runs the frame, handshake, session and
   loopback suites; the loopback suite needs local socket access and opens
   about two thousand sockets. Check README examples with the pinned Lean
   toolchain as well. Where Docker is available, run the Autobahn fuzzing
   client against `lake exe leanws_echo` as described in the README and keep
   the report.
5. Review the diff, commit the release changes, and confirm that the working
   tree is clean and the release includes the current remote `main`.

## Publish

Use the release's changelog section as its GitHub release notes. Put the exact
notes in a temporary file and pass it to `gh release create --notes-file`.

For a version such as `0.1.0`, after the checks above:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "leanws v0.1.0"
git push --atomic origin main v0.1.0
gh release create v0.1.0 --repo theoriclabs/leanws --verify-tag \
  --title "LeanWs 0.1.0" --notes-file /path/to/release-notes.md
```

Use the version being released in place of the example. Publish only the
validated commit. Do not move an existing release tag; make a new release for
subsequent code changes. If branch protection requires a pull request, merge
through the required process before tagging the resulting commit.

Finally, verify that the remote tag points to the tested commit and the GitHub
release is published with the expected notes. Report its URL. Source-only
releases use GitHub's generated source archives; no native binaries are required.
